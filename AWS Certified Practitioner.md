# Cloud Concepts
## Cloud Platform Models
Infrastructure as a Service
<p>
Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) products generally simulate the look and feel you’d get from
managing physical resources. IaaS products give you direct access to a provider’s compute, storage,
and networking assets. Because it’s you that’s in there playing around at the hardware level,
you—rather than the IaaS provider—are responsible for the consequences of any bad configurations.
The trade-off is that you get to closely configure every layer of your operating stack.
You’ll learn much more about these examples later in the book, but AWS IaaS products
include Elastic Cloud Compute (EC2) for virtual machine instances, Elastic Block Store
(EBS) for storage volumes, and Elastic Load Balancing.

Platform as a Service
<p>
Unlike IaaS, Platform as a Service (PaaS) products simplify the process of building an application
by hiding the complexity of the infrastructure that runs it. You’re given an interface
through which you define the behavior and environment you want for your application.
This will often include the code that will run your application.
AWS PaaS products include Elastic Beanstalk and Elastic Container Service (ECS).

Software as a Service
<p>
Software as a Service (SaaS) products offer services meant to be accessed by end users. An
easily recognizable illustration is Google’s Gmail service, which allows users to manage
their email by logging in to a browser interface or through an email client (like Microsoft
Outlook) that’s running locally.
While some may disagree with the designation, AWS SaaS products arguably include
Simple Email Service and Amazon WorkSpaces.
